		Exercise 9 - Solving Laplace Equatuions I

	----- Solving Laplace Equations -----
This first was in a similar way in exercise 4, hence it was quite intuitive to solve.


	----- Selecting Constrained Vertices -----
The harmonic function needed some drawings for a better understanding of the problem. We also had to well think at what all function's parameters mean.

	----- Generating Edges at Isolines of Harmonic Functions -----
Once borders' interval was found, with a "delta-resize-bias" process, we applied the geometric reflexion we made at the previous point.
